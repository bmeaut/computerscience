# Module 3 - Cross-Platform Mobile Application Development with Xamarin

This module introduces a survey of cross-platform mobile development, the basics of Xamarin, and the foundations of C#. This module proceeds to cover Xamarin development basics for Android, iOS, and UWP apps; including the basics of using Xamarin.Forms and testing Xamarin apps. Finally, this module demonstrates deploying an app (using Azure app services) and getting the app into an app store.
