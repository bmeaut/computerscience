## Complimentary Course Content

Source: [https://github.com/Microsoft/computerscience/tree/master/Educator%20Resources/Complimentary%20Course%20Content](.)

This library of complimentary course content is intended for use in classroom settings. Modules are divided by scenario (Cloud Computing, Web Dev, Data Science, DevOps) and can function autonomously or can be taught progressively as a course. Most modules includes presentations, speaker notes, and labs that help students demonstrate knowledge of the material. Your feedback is appreciated as we continue to improve this library.

If you want to report any issues we need to fix. Please log an [issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/computerscience/issues). Include the content section (Tech Talk, Workshop, Course Content), module number and title, along with any error messages and screenshots.

| 4      | [Data Analysis Using Hadoop](/Educator%20Resources/Complimentary%20Course%20Content/Module4) | This module introduces Big Data, its platforms, and its analysis. Hadoop is the most popular approach to Big Data, for storing and computing statistics for massive data sets. The module describes Big Data, Hadoop, Hadoop's ecosystems, and Hive. In the labs, Hive is presented as the main context to show how massive data sets can be analyzed. At the end of this module, students should know how to use Hive for Big Data Analysis. | [Labs](/Educator%20Resources/Complimentary%20Course%20Content/Module4/Labs) |
| 5      | [Data Science and Machine Learning in Spark](/Educator%20Resources/Complimentary%20Course%20Content/Module5) | This module introduces the fundamental concepts of data science and machine learning using Spark and Spark Machine Learning library. Thus, at the end of the course, students should know the fundamental concepts of machine learning and be adapt Spark for machine learning and data science to predict the trend and patterns of massive data sets. | [Labs](/Educator%20Resources/Complimentary%20Course%20Content/Module5/Labs) |
| 6      | [Internet of Things (IoT)](/Educator%20Resources/Complimentary%20Course%20Content/Module6) | This module covers the fundamental concepts of the Internet of Things. IoT can be considered a system of sensor devices and data sources that generate streaming data.
