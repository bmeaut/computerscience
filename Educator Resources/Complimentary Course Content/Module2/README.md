# Module 2 - Web Development

This module introduces the foundations of JavaScript — the language of the web. Additionally this module covers using Node.js to build a back-end, how to use JavaScript on a server to build RESTful APIs and how to deploy to a scalable and convenient cloud hosting platform (Azure Cloud Services/Websites) with persistent data using a NoSQL database (Azure Storage).
