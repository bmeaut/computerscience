# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 1 - Teacher's Guide
## Overview

Week 1 introduces cognitive computing and the development environment for the project. The first four hours of this project will break down into these sections, which can be done one per day:

**Day 1:**  Cognitive computing demonstrations and explanation

**Day 2:**  VS Code intro and lab

**Day 3:**  Azure and GitHub intro and lab

**Day 4:**  Explore Artificial Intelligence (AI)


Here is detail of these Week 1 course days:

## Day 1

The first day is about exploring what is possible in the world of cognitive computing. This course will give special focus to vision and text and examples will reflect that. The instructor will demonstrate examples of cognitive computing while also introducing the foundational concepts, including machine learning, models, and artificial intelligence. The era ahead of us will bear much growth and change in this area, and these changes to our culture and commerce are expected to supercede even the internet. It will be an exciting time ahead and these examples and concepts provide just a hint of what is to come. Explore the Azure Cognitive API in all of its facets, with special focus on Vision and Text.

## Day 2

VS Code is the next topic, with an overview by the instructor. The students will get hands-on with the coding environment they'll be using for this course: VS Code. This free, open-source editor lets the student create projects on Mac, Windows, and Linux, and debug and run them with ease. The lab will include the creation of a project and files, editing of markdown, and running of code.

## Day 3

Day three involves wrapping up the VS Code Lab, signing up for Azure and GitHub, cloning a GitHub project in VS Code, and exploring code examples in VS Code. This day will orient the students sufficiently that they may strike out on their own, experimenting with the tools they will use in this project.

## Day 4

After the VS Code and GitHub labs are completed, day four is for exploring AI in the context of cognitive computing and examining real-world examples of AI, a commonly used term. The student project for this course will be introduced. End the week with an explanation of the class project. Finally the instructor should get students thinking about ways that they would use cognitive computing.
