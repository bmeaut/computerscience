# Azure Cognitive Services Project
Azure Cognitive Services are a set of intelligent algorithms that give your apps the power to see, hear, speak, understand, and interpret what your users need through natural communication. Basically, the ability to easily add AI to any simple application youâ€™re building. 

Watch Dr. Sarah Guthals give an intro to this project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zGi2k59cXo&feature=youtu.be).

Through this pilot TEALS project, students will be able to explore Azure Cognitive Services to get an idea of the vast ideas they could bring to life with the power of Azure. Students will be exposed to:
-	Python
-	Azure Notebooks (Jupyter Notebooks)
-	Azure Cognitive Services
-	API calls 
-	App Design
-	Ethics of AI

Students will be asked to form groups and come up with an idea for an app that would use Azure Cognitive Services for social good.

A simple example is:
Using public images from Instagram, a new technology could couple geolocation and images run through cognitive services to identify which cities prefer dogs to cats and which prefer cats to dogs. The social good aspect could be to help animals find homes faster by moving cats to cities that prefer cats and dogs to cities that prefer dogs.

Students will explore the Azure Cognitive Services APIs through Python API calls in Azure Notebooks and review the JSON output to better understand how AI tools gather information about text and images. For example, using the Text API you can see that Azure has confidence that the first sentence is very negative, the second is very positive, and the third is positive, but has some negative aspects:

After exploring these APIs, students will present to the class their ideas for an app that would use these, including examples of input that they would use and how the output would inform their conclusions. 

Finally, the students would have a conversation about ethics and AI, focusing on the facts that data can be biased and incomplete, making your conclusions biased and incomplete. 

Using that same simple example:
If you gathered all of the images from Instagram, counted all of the ones featuring dogs and cats and mapped those counts, that wouldn't account for all of the people who don't have Instagram, don't have public Instagrams, and/or don't post pictures of their pets online. So if you actually made an assumption about where dogs would be most likely to be adopted over cats based soley on this data gathering exercise, you may be not accounting for the fact that people who have cats simply don't post their pictures on Instagram.
