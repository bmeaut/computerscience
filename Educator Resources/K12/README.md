# K-12 Azure Educator Resources
Azure Education can include a number of different areas. This repo will be kept up to date with various projects and lessons
that are likely to be a good fit for novices in the K-12 space.

# Current Offerings
## Azure for Students Starter
A free Azure account with access to educational services and no credit card required to sign up. You can learn more about
it [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/starter/)

## Azure for Students
A free Azure account plus a $100 credit for students 18+ and no credit card required to sign up. You can learn more about it
[here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/)

## Introduction to Data Science
We've developed a ~30 hour workshop for adults interested in learning about Python and Data Science, but this curriculum is also
effective for high school students. You can find this [here](https://github.com/microsoft/computerscience/tree/master/Educator%20Resources/Reactor%20Workshops/Data%20Science)

## Introduction to AI
As part of Microsoft TEALS, we offer a 4-week project for students to experiment with Azure Cognitive Services. Students
can quickly start exploring how these services can give insight to complex data such as images. Visit the project
[here](https://github.com/microsoft/computerscience/tree/master/Educator%20Resources/TEALS)

## Minecraft Multiplayer VM
To give more access to Minecraft: Education Edition Multiplayer experience to more schools, we have launched an Azure VM so that
educators do not have to have a high-end machine to be able to have their entire class connect and collaborate on Minecraft. 
Learn about it [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/host-multiplayer-minecraft-education-edition-on-azure-virtual-machines/)

## Image Data Predicting Climate Change
In collaboration with HackingSTEM and NASA, we have a introduction to Machine Learning for middle and high school students. With
Excel and a simple web app, students can learn about how color in images can help us understand how our climate is changing, 
and then mimic a machine learning model to understand how Azure helps do this at scale. Check out the lesson [here](https://preview.education.microsoft.com/hackingStem/lesson/nv3zo6ad) and the machine learning demo [here](https://nasa-on-azure.azurewebsites.net/)
