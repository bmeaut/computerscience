# Azure University Tour

Welcome to the [Azure University Tour](https://www.microsoftevents.com/profile/web/index.cfm?PKwebID=0x765986abcd)! In this series of challenges, you'll build a few of the features from the [ContosoBNB](https://contosobnb.azurewebsites.net/) web app, the one that was demo'ed during the keynote.

Take your pick of 3 labs. Each one takes 45 minutes - 1 hour to complete so select the one with the tech you're most interested in learning about:

* [Big Data](https://github.com/MSFTImagine/computerscience/tree/master/Azure%20University%20Tour/BigDataHOL): Your team has recently obtained public data about rental properties in four cities in the United States, each in a distinct comma-separated value (CSV) file. You have been tasked with finding the most recent rental data in these large files and also with finding a way to search for all rental properties that match any given criteria within a specific area. Includes Azure Data Science Virtual Machine running Windows Server, Azure Data Lake Store and Azure Data Lake, and U-SQL.

* [Machine Learning](https://github.com/MSFTImagine/computerscience/tree/master/Azure%20University%20Tour/MachineLearningHOL): You are acting as a newly-hired data scientist. Your goal is to begin building, training, and tuning a machine learning model to suggest a rental rate that maximizes revenue for rental property owners. Includes Azure Data Science Virtual Machine running Linux with many popular open-source tools including Jupyter, RStudio, and Python scikit-learn.

* [Artificial Intelligence with Web App](https://github.com/MSFTImagine/computerscience/tree/master/Azure%20University%20Tour/WebAppHOL): You will experience the benefits of using AI first-hand. You will begin the lab by downloading a short-term vacation-rental web app called ContosoBNB. Then you will incorporate the Local Insights API, an experimental project in the Azure Cognitive Services family. Project Local Insights provides a custom score for the attractiveness of a location according to a user's select preferences. After incorporating the API, the ContosoBNB application renders a Bing Maps image of several cities within the United States where the project is supported. Circles appear on the rendered map to represent neighborhoods, and each circle displays a number that corresponds to the number of available properties within that neighborhood. Neighborhoods are also rated according to preference settings that the user can adjust. Finally, using the API, you will alter the neighborhood criteria (categories) displayed in the user interface. This step enables you to customize the attractiveness score of a neighborhood so that the score is determined by its proximity to amenities you prioritize (such as restaurants or parks) within the defined area.
